Aveiro is a charming coastal city in central Portugal, often called “the Portuguese Venice” thanks to its scenic canals and traditional moliceiro boats.

Blending a strong academic and research ecosystem — anchored by the University of Aveiro — with maritime heritage, Art Nouveau architecture, and a relaxed lifestyle, Aveiro offers a distinctive setting for PyCon Portugal 2026.

Located next to the Ria de Aveiro, a unique coastal lagoon of high ecological and cultural value, the city combines urban life, nature, beaches, and gastronomy within short distances — ideal for both conference focus and social exploration.
